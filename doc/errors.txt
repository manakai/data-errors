errors.json
~~~~~~~~~~~

The |data/errors.json| file contains errors and their descriptions.

The file contains a JSON object, whose name/value pairs are error
types and their descriptions.

Descriptions are JSON objects, which contains zero or more of
following name/value pairs:

  default_error_level [string?]

    The default error level, which is typically used with the error
    type, if known.  The value is one of error level values as
    described in |onerror.txt|.

  desc [object?]

    JSON object whose name/value pairs are language tags and longer
    descriptions of the error in the language.

    The value is an HTML fragment that can be used where flow content
    is expected.

  layer [string?]

    The typical processing stage in which the error might be detected.
    The value is one of following values:

      |character-set|     Character interpretation
      |tokenization|      Tokenization
      |tree-construction| Tree construction
      |namespaces|        Namespace processing

  message [object?]

    JSON object whose name/value pairs are language tags and text
    messages describing the error in the language.

    The value is an HTML fragment that can be used where phrasing
    content is expected.

    The value can contain HTML |var| elements whose content is a text
    node with data |{...}| where "..." is one of following variable
    names, can be used to dynamically construct error message:

      text               The |text| value of the error.
      value              The |value| value of the error.
      local-name         The |localName| of the |node| of the error.
      element-local-name The |localName| of the |ownerElement| of the
                         |node| of the error.
      @                  The |nodeValue| of the |node| of the error.

  modules [object?]

    JSON object whose names are Perl package name (or pseudo Perl
    package name) and values are boolean true values.  Package names
    represent that the error type is used by that module.  Package
    names might not be actual module names; for example, there is no
    Perl module or package |Web::HTML::Parser::tokenizer| in fact, but
    it represents the tokenizer feature of the |Web::HTML::Parser|
    module.

  parser_error_names [object?]

    JSON object whose names are error names used in parser data files
    (see, e.g.,
    <https://github.com/manakai/data-web-defs/blob/master/doc/html-syntax.txt>)
    corresponding to the error type and values are boolean true
    values.  Note that there can be exactly one error type for a
    parser error name.

  parser_tests

    JSON array containing test data for HTML parsers.  Array items are
    JSON objects with following name/value pairs:

      context [string?]

        The local name of the context element, if any.  Note that the
        namespace is the HTML namespace.  If this value is not
        specified, there is no context element.

      index [number]

        The offset in the |input| at which an error with the error
        type is expected to be reported.

      input [string]

        The input character string to be tested.

      level [string?]

        The error level of the error.  If not specified, the default
        error level (|default_error_level|) of the error type is
        expected.

      noscript [boolean]

        Whether the scripting flag of the parser used to parse the
        |input| is NOT set.

      text [string?]

        The value of the |text| field of the error, if any, or |null|,
        otherwise.

      value [string?]

        The value of the |value| field of the error, if any, or
        |null|, otherwise.

    Note that the |input| might contain other errors, too.

  targets [object?]

    If specified, JSON object whose name/value pairs are target names
    and boolean true values.  They represent kinds of targets of the
    error.  The available target name is:

      |attr|   The error is about the attribute (not only attribute value).

Language tags are BCP 47 language tags, normalized in lowercase.
