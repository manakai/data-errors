~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The file contains list of well-formed, validity, and namespace
constaraints as specified in XML and XML Namespaces specifications.

Current version of the file only contains "constraints" in XML
specifications.  It does not contain all requirements for the XML
documents.  Future version of the file might be extended to contain
more requirements from the specification.

The file does not contain requirements in earlier editions of XML
specifications that are no longer part of the latest edition.

* Structure

The file contains a JSON object where names are unique IDs for
constraints and values are descriptions of constraints.

Each constraint value is a JSON object with following name/value
pairs:

  id [id-in-spec]

    The identifier in the specification identified by the |spec|
    value.

  name [string]

    The human-readable short name of the constraint, as shown in the
    specification, without prefix such as "Well-formedness
    constraint".

  type [string]

    Type of the constraint, which is one of followings:

      nsc  A namespace constraint
      vc   A validity constraint
      wfc  A well-formedness constraint

  spec [spec]

    The specification in which the constraint is defined.

List of constraints are extracted from specifications by the following
JavaScript code:

JSON.stringify (Array.prototype.filter.apply (document.querySelectorAll('b'), [function (c) { return c.textContent.match (/constraint:/) }]).map (function (n) { return {name: n.textContent.replace (/^(?:Well-formedness|Validity)\s*constraint:\s*/, ''), type: n.textContent.match (/Well-formed/) ? 'wfc' : n.textContent.match (/Validity/) ? 'vc' : n.textContent.match (/Namespace/) ? 'nsc' : '', id: n.parentNode.id} }))
